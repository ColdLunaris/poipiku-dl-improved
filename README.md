# poipiku-dl

A tool written in Python to download images from poipiku. Tested on Linux. 

## Requirements
Some pip modules are needed for poipiku-dl to work. Some of them are already pre-installed on your system. Copy-paste this command and you should be good here:

`pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4`


If you still get an error for missing modules, that's when Google helps you out.

This does not take any arguments at the moment, and you have to place a cookie-file named cookie.txt in the same directory as main.py
